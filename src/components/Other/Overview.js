            readable. This is a big plus in my opinion. Readability is often shunned in favour of functionality but I believe good code has both. It becomes even more important if working as part of a team or releasing code
            to be used by others because if they struggle to read it they will struggle to use it.`

            It allows us to edit all parts of web page presentation from font size to opacity. CSS was created by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on October 10th, 1994 and is maintained by the
            CSS working group withing W3C. The W3C or world wide web consortium is a group that makes recommendations about how the web should evolve but it is up to the development
            community to implement these recommendations.`
